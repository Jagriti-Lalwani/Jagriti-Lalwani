I am currently pursuing data analysis because I can make data alive by adding visulaizations to it. It is intriguing, challenging and most flexible domain of working. A data analyst can work in science observatories, health sector, media, entertainment and business sector. I am an extrovert and I believe that this is the right field for people who love to try new things. 
* 😎 I'm currently working on some astronomical datasets

### My Interests
My primary interest is Cosmology and High Energy Physics. I pursue data analysis because I really love to play with cosmological datasets. I am fascinated by the observations collected to capture first picture of black hole. I thus develop instincts to learn data handling because it use all powerful tools of statistics to give us real time outputs.
