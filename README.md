I am currently pursuing data analysis because I can make data alive by adding visulaizations to it. It is intriguing, challenging and most flexible domain of working. A data analyst can work in science observatories, health sector, media, entertainment and business sector. I am an extrovert and I believe that this is the right field for people who love to try new things.
